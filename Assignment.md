## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

- **Branching**: Helped me separate features and prevent conflicts when working on different sections of the site. I could develop each feature independently and merge them safely.

- **Commit Conventions**: Structured commit messages made it easier to track the purpose of changes. This was especially helpful when reviewing commit history or debugging issues.

- **Pull Requests**: Allowed me to review and document feature branches before merging. It ensured I maintained a clean main branch and caught potential problems early.

- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: I learned how to detect and resolve conflicts when two branches modify the same part of a file. This skill was crucial when collaborating with others or merging overlapping work.
